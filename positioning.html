    <p2>Sweetener, Grande’s first album had made to that list.
        This album shows how strong her singing his.
        It feels more honest and alot more personal and it had shown how much so have grown. From the song God is a Woman to Breathin the whole album from pop to a little rnb.
        She’s a singer who, in instances like this, knows how to turn it down to get us up.
